            I love football â€“ especially college football. I wanted to do a React project that involved consuming an
            REST Service API. I stumbled across an interesting API called <span><a
                    href="http://api.collegefootballdata.com/">College Football Data API.</a></span> When I examined
            the available data sources,
            I got the idea of constructing a dashboard that would consolidate some of the data by a selected team. There
            was so much more data available that I could have included, but I choose the information that I think is
            most relevant when I want to know more about a particular team. So, I chose to include tables for general
            team information, results/schedules, conference standings, roster, and recruiting. I thoroughly enjoyed
            working on this project.

            For HTTP requests, I used the Axios JavaScript library. I used Material-UI for the team and year selectors.
            For
            code demonstration purposes, I mainly used stateless functional components. But the App component is a
            conventional class component. This project did not require a whole lot of state management, so I chose not
            to use Redux in this case, Instead, I used React Hooks and passed state information to child components as
            props.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project was rather straightforward from a design and development perspective. By far the most
            challenging aspect of it was working with the JSON data that the API returned. In some cases, there was no
            direct linking fields between the team and other information related to that team. For instance, there was
            no common ID between a given team and its venue information. To connect them, I had to use a third table of
            historical games to find the venue id of the home team when the home team was the selected team. This really
            put my skills of using JavaScript array functions and asynchronous calls to the test. But, it was a lot of
            fun seeing it all come together.
